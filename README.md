# Swift-URLSession-Combine
URLSession with Swift - past to future with Combine

Requirements: Xcode 11.2

Apple's new [Combine Framework ](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)is **significant** in it's declaration: 

"*The Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events. Combine declares publishers to expose values that can change over time, and subscribers to receive those values from the publishers.*"

This app demo's some of it's capabilities in context of URLSession.
